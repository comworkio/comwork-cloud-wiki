## 2FA / MFA (multiple factor authentication)

We **strongly** advise you to enable the 2FA/MFA.

### With a 2FA app (i.e: Google Authenticator)

Go to your settings:

![enable_2fa_app](./img/enable_2fa_app.png)

Then:

![qr_2fa](./img/qr_2fa.png)

You have to register an otp device with a 2FA application which is able to scan QR codes like [Google authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) which is available for Android and IOS/IpadOS.

![authenticator](./img/authenticator.png)

Flash the QR code with this app (or the one you prefer) and write the otp code.

Then you'll have to write the 6 digits otp code printed on this application each time you sign-in:

![2fa_code](./img/2fa_code.png)

### With an USB device (ie: Yubico)

Go to your settings:

![enable_2fa_usb_device](./img/enable_2fa_usb_device.png)

Then you'll arrive on this screen:

![2fa_usb_device](./img/2fa_usb_device.png)

Just press your key button and it should be work.
