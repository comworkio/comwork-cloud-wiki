## 2FA / MFA (multiple factor authentication)

We **strongly** advise you to enable the 2FA/MFA. 

In order to do that, go to your settings:

![enable_2fa](./img/enable_2fa.png)

Then:

![qr_2fa](./img/qr_2fa.png)

You have to register an otp device with a 2FA application which is able to scan QR codes like Google authenticator which is available for Android and IOS/IpadOS:

![authenticator_playstor](./img/authenticator_playstor.png)

Flash the QR code with this app (or the one you prefer) and write the otp code.

Then you'll have to write the 6 digits otp code printed on this application each time you sign-in.
