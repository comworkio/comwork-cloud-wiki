## Public console

The console is here: https://cloud.comwork.io

First you can register and ask to the comwork team to enable your account with a conf meeting you can setup [here](https://calendly.com/idriss-neumann/intro-comwork-cloud).

Then you'll be able to create your gitlab projects:

![project](./img/project.png)

Then your instances:

![create_instance](./img/create_instance.png)

![created_instance](./img/create_instance.png)

After creating your instance, you'll be able manage it from the web console:

![instance](./img/instance.png)

## Administrators

You can manage the environments which are a set of ansible roles and templates.

![environments](./img/environments.png)

Keeping environment private will make the environment not accessible for non-admin users.
