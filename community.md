# Community and support

## Support and emergencies

We **strongly** advise you to always open tickets in the first time, because it's this way we'll get noticed of your issues in real time.

You can follow [this tutoriel](./tutorials/console/public/support.md) to see how to open a ticket.

## Git repositories

Here's our git repositories:

* Main repo: https://gitlab.comwork.io/comwork_public/comwork_cloud
* Github mirror: https://github.com/idrissneumann/comwork-cloud-wiki.git
* Gitlab mirror: https://gitlab.com/ineumann/comwork-cloud-wiki.git

You can use all those repositories in order to:
* Send us pull requests/merge requests if you think there's room of improvments
* Open tickets for any bug you want to share about cloud.comwork.com or its API, cli, whatever related
* Ask for new features or evolutions

## Mastodon, slack and discord

You can join our [Mastodon](https://mastodon.comwork.io), [Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/comwork-cloud/shared_invite/zt-1h04v2jp0-cF9p53MzfzxuChVobWKQEQ) or [Discord server](https://discord.gg/CXskxxPauz) in order to ask help or sharing with the community.

You can there directly talk with the team to accelerate the communications once the ticket are created but also share your technical insights with the rest of the community and get help by the other members.
