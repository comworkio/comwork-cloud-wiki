# Sizing and pricing

The sizing and pricing model is following the [Scaleway's one](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/?tags=available,compute-instances-developmentinstances) and add 70% for our internal APIs and compute costs and support (you can see the details below).

So those pricing can be readjusted following the Scaleway's pricing evolutions.
