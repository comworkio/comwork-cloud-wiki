# Overleaf as a service

Get your research and development team to the next level using your instances of Overleaf.

[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) is an opensource online platform for generating document from LaTex input and work in a collaborative way similar to gitlab or github. Very suitable for a research and development team.

What's the difference with the overleaf SaaS version:
* It can be hosted in __Europe__ ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º (including __France__ ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·) with French providers (like Scaleway or OVH)
* It's like you own a VPS, it's your own instance with your chosen sizing: you'll not be limited by a number of projects, whatsoever
