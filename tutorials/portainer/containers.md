You can watch logs from containers clicking on this icon:

![portainer_logs1](../../img/portainer_logs1.png)

Then you can read the live logs and download them in order to be able to opening them in a more suitable editor to perform some research:

## Opening a shell inside a container

For example, connecting inside redis:

![portainer_connect_container_1](../../img/portainer_connect_container_1.png)

Choose the shell available inside your container (i.e: `#!/bin/bash` here):

![portainer_connect_container_2](../../img/portainer_connect_container_2.png)

The launch your commands (here we use `redis-cli` in order to monitor what's is stored in redis):

![portainer_connect_container_3](../../img/portainer_connect_container_3.png)
