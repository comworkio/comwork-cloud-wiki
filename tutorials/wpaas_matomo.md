[^1]: wordpress as a service

## Init your wordpress instance

Once your instance is up, you can click on the `open` link here:

![instance_open_link](../img/instance_open_link.png)

It'll ask for a username and password and it's the following:

* username: `admin`
* password: `changeit`

You can change your password in the `env/{env_name}.yml` file:

```yaml
wp_admin_users:
  - name: admin
    passwd: $apr1$M4x65b92$KsQCdoC.BzdBcuTai2MuG0
```

For generating a new password to copy in the `passwd` field:

```shell
htpasswd -c .htpasswd.tmp admin
cat .htpasswd.tmp | cut -d ":" -f2 # copy the output as passwd
rm -rf .htpasswd.tmp
```

## Migrate an existing Wordpress to cwcloud WPaaS

### On the old instance to move

1. Create a bucket on cwcloud and keep the endpoint, access key, secret key

If you're in the SaaS version, ask for [object storage access](../storage.md).

You'll find the credentials here:

![wpaas-bucket](../img/wpaas-bucket.png)

2. Search, install and activate the "All in one migration" plugin:

![wpaas-all-in-one-plugin](../img/wpaas-all-in-one-plugin.png)

3. Upload, install and activate the following extensions:

* `all-in-one-wp-migration-unlimited-extension.zip`
* `all-in-one-wp-migration-s3-client-extension.zip`

This way:

![wpaas-all-in-one-exts](../img/wpaas-all-in-one-exts.png)

Those two extensions have to be purchased [here](https://servmask.com/).

If you're in a development contract with [comwork.io](https://www.comwork.io), we have the ability to use our own purchased one with our customers.
