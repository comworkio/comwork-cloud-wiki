# API Credentials

In order to create API credentials, go here:

![cw_creds_1](../../img/cw_creds_1.png)

Then create new Api Key and Api Secret like that:

![cw_creds_2](../../img/cw_creds_2.png)

The you can pick the secret key as `X-Auth-Token` in the Restful API and both the access and secret keys for the [cli](../cli/README.md).
