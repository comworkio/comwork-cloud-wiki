# Wordpress as a service

A secured and dedicated Wordpress instance a service.

Yet another "Wordpress as a Service" (WPaaS) with some benefits :

* It's hosted in __France__ 🇫🇷 (with [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com), a really beautiful French cloud provider)
* You choose the sizing of your instance as you'll pick your own VPS
* Rolling upgrades of Wordpress / PHP / MySQL
* __Very strong security__: https/TLS encryption, firewalling, DDoS protection and wp-admin double authentication
* An expert _engineering team_ which is available on Slack
* SEO insights with your __Matomo__ instance (see [here](./matomo.md))

Especially, this WPaaS is the right for you if you want to deploy and manage your reverse proxy and certificate like a real ops who work with ansible in a gitops way ;-p

_One of our most valuable partner, the [GDA Sidi Amor](https://sidiamor.org) which was struggling with multiple low cost shared hosting with lots of down time, TLS certificates, very old versions of PHP or MySQL and no security and backups. They almost lost everything!_
