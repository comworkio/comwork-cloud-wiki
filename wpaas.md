# Wordpress as a service

A secured and dedicated Wordpress instance a service.

Yet another "Wordpress as a Service" (WPaaS) with some benefits :

* It's hosted in __France__ ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· (with [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com), a really beautiful French cloud provider)
* You choose the sizing of your instance as you'll pick your own VPS
* Rolling upgrades of Wordpress / PHP / MySQL
* __Very strong security__: https/TLS encryption, firewalling, DDoS protection and wp-admin double authentication
* An expert _engineering team_ which is available on Slack
* SEO insights with your __Matomo__ instance (see [here](./matomo.md))

Especially, this WPaaS is the right for you if you want to deploy and manage your reverse proxy and certificate like a real ops who work with ansible in a gitops way ;-p
