# VSCode - IDE as a service

A full dev|ops local environment on the cloud.

Yet another "_gitpod like environment_" with the real tools you're using locally everyday. 

It embed our everyday tools and CLI like docker, docker-compose, k3d, k9s, kubectl, kubeseal, terraform, terragrunt, node, python, ansible, lt, gcloud, jq, yq and you'll be able to add more tools in your instance using the apt command directly on the terminal.

You also get a fully access to the compute instance hosting this web IDE, like it's your own one.

## The differences with gitpod?

Of course [gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io), [coder](https://coder.com), [google cloud shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell), github codespaces are great and bring lots of value for a very large amount of users. But there's value we can bring comparing to those two :

* It can be hosted in Europe ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º (including France ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·) with French providers (like Scaleway or OVH)
* All those needed dependancies are already there: docker, docker-compose, k3d, k9s, kubectl, kubeseal, ansible, terraform, terragrunt, gcloud, jq, yq, lt
* Keep and store the state of your git repositories, oci registries credentials, ssh keys, gpg keys, etc
* It's like you own a VPS, it's your own instance with your chosen sizing: you'll not be limited by a number of hours, number of git workspaces, whatsoever 
* You'll be able to install and keep vscode extensions
* You can have a dedicated [tunnel server](./localtunnel.md) that allows you to forward your http(s) ports with a public TLS secured url on your own TLS zones and keep the same urls (see [this tutorial](./tutorials/localtunnel.md) to learn more about it)
* Lots of improvements are coming:  
  * we'll provide an [API](https://cloud-api.comwork.io), a [web console](https://cloud.comwork.io) and a terraform module in order to give you : 
  * the ability to shutdown and restart your instances when your not using it in order to reduce the cost
  * the persistence of git repositories and docker registries from anywhere even after the destruction/recreation of your instance (based on top of a stored states/events architecture)
  * the rolling upgrades
