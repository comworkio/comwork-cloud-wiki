# Comwork Cloud

Here's the documentation of [comwork cloud console](https://cloud.comwork.io) and [API](https://cloud-api.comwork.io).

"_CwCloud_" (for _Comwork Cloud_) is a DaaS[^1] and FaaS[^2] platform that allows us to speed up the provisioning of the infrastructure and managed service such as [serverless FaaS engine](./serverless.md), [Advanced web IDE](./code.md), [DBaaS](./dbaas.md)[^3], [WPaaS](./wpaas.md)[^4], or any other application you want to deploy as a managed service.

There is a SaaS version which provide instances that are hosted on [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com) or [OVHCloud](https://www.ovhcloud.com). Those two are really beautiful European ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º cloud providers and we intend to propose even more cloud providers in the future (CwCloud can work with any cloud provider that provide standard IaaS[^5] API's such as OpenStack or Kubernetes).

There is also a way to deploy a [self-hosted version of CwCloud](./tutorials/selfhosted.md) with your own prefered cloud provider and account. The self-hosted version is also compatible with [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com), [GCP](https://cloud.google.com), [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) and [cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) (for the DNS records).
