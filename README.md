# Comwork Cloud

Here's the documentation of [comwork cloud console](https://cloud.comwork.io) and [API](https://cloud-api.comwork.io).

It allows us to provide cloud SaaS services like [code](./code.md) or [wpaas](./wpaas.md) in a "IaC" (infrastructure as code) way: you'll get access to a private [comwork gitlab](https://gitlab.comwork.io) repository that contains ansible roles and playbooks you'll be able to maintain. The modification on this repositories will automatically be applied in your instances.

The instances are hosted on [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com) or [OVHCloud](https://www.ovhcloud.com) for now. Those two are really beautiful European ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º cloud providers and we intend to propose even more cloud providers in the future).
